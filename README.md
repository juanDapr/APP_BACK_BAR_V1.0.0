# APP_BACK_BAR_V1.0.0

Application Description

The mobile application is designed to revolutionize the experience at bars and restaurants by implementing a modern and efficient ordering and payment system. Each table in the establishment will have a unique QR code that customers can scan to place orders and make payments directly from their mobile devices. This not only streamlines the service process but also reduces wait times and enhances customer satisfaction.
Key Features

    Real-Time Notifications: Customers receive updates on the status of their orders.
    Role Customization: Separate roles for users (customers) and business administrators (staff) are established.

Application Architecture

The application is designed using a microservices architecture, which allows for greater flexibility, scalability, and maintenance. Below are the key components of the architecture:
1. Frontend (Mobile Application)

    User Interface: A mobile application available for iOS and Android, developed using a cross-platform framework like Flutter or React Native.
    Backend Integration: Communicates with the microservices through a REST API, using an API gateway to manage requests.

2. Backend (Microservices)

    Authentication Service: Manages account creation, login, and user roles.
    Menu Service: Provides menu details, including product options, prices, and descriptions.
    Order Service: Handles the creation, updating, and tracking of orders.
    Payment Service: Processes payments, handling multiple methods like credit cards, digital wallets, and more.
    Notification Service: Sends real-time notifications about order status.

3. Database

    Relational Database: Stores information about users, menus, orders, and transactions. Systems like PostgreSQL or MySQL are recommended.

4. Security

    Authentication and Authorization: Uses JWT tokens for user authentication and permission management.
    Data Encryption: Protects sensitive data such as payment information.

5. User Roles

    Users (Customers): Can place orders and make payments through the app.
    Administrators (Business Staff): Can manage the menu, review orders, and generate reports.
